##Question 

**Que1: Is MongoDB always better than the mysql?**
>Ans: In terms of performance of a single simple query, MongoDB will be a lot faster than MySQL. 
>In my experience, you will notice differences under heavy load situations in some special situations.
>In MySQL all competent database administrators should be aware of the importance of indexes.
>Compared to MongoDB it seems that most administrators don’t even know that something like indexes exist!
>That might come from the fact, that MongoDB is a structureless database, so why should I care?
>But I want to point out here that proper index usage is at least as important as with other database engines.
